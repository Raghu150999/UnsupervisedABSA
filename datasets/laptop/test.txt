0	4	1	glad i did so far .
1	3	1	great battery life .
2	2	1	the screen is great , i do n't see the need for a retina display .
3	2	1	i love the new high retina display , and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter .
4	4	1	i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon , but ... you 're just living in denial if you do n't .
5	4	1	happy buying !
6	4	0	etc . but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck !
7	4	0	thank you asus . ( they do n't deserve to be capitalized )
8	4	1	very great apple product as expected .
9	3	1	good battery life .
10	2	1	great color on screen .
11	2	1	it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
12	5	0	the touchpad is a little & quot ; clunky & quot ; for my taste ; i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event .
13	5	0	i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled & quot ; pinch zoom. & quot ;
14	3	1	battery life is great - though it is new .
15	0	0	each time , apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over .
16	3	1	even the battery life is like wow !
17	3	1	it contains a long battery life , incredible specs , and an overall enjoyable performance .
18	1	1	upgrading from a toshiba laptop , i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides .
19	0	1	they were great .
20	4	1	how could you not love a mac
21	2	1	love the flip feature and the touch screen feature .
22	4	1	to a prospective buyer , 08/10/2012 once you go mac , you 'll never go back .
23	2	1	because it is a touch screen you do n't even need a mouse .
24	7	1	lastly , because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard .
25	1	1	i enjoy the simplicity and user-friendly interface of yosemite .
26	1	1	i 'm excited for el capitan .
27	6	1	the apps are very easy to use .
28	2	1	the resolution is excellent .
29	2	1	- it 's not touchscreen !
30	7	0	i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good .
31	2	0	i find myself adjusting it regularly .
32	7	0	the space bar sticks .
33	2	1	the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display , not in the least the mac pro works just fine .
34	1	1	the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .
35	6	1	if you want to use the internet , then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen , like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon .
36	2	1	- touchscreen is great .
37	2	1	the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down .
38	2	1	the screen has an extremely high resolution that i 'm very pleased with .
39	3	0	my daughter 's macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago .
40	0	0	it took 3 days to make an appointment at the local apple store .
41	0	0	i 'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $ 129 for a new battery , $ 39 to replace it and $ 139 for a new keyboard .
42	0	0	i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager .
43	0	0	he explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal ' .
44	0	0	apple does n't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care .
45	0	0	the battery is simply considered 'consumable ' and not covered .
46	0	0	i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple does n't consider the product defective .
47	0	0	his reply astonished me , looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said : 'make sure you have your facts straight before you smear !
48	0	0	he did n't specify who are 'they ' but from the tone of his voice and his 6 ' 5 ' posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers .
49	4	0	here is my take on all of this , the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china , hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school , call them geniuses , and bully everybody who complains about their product .
50	4	0	steve jobs is dead , so is apple .
51	4	0	no more apple devices in my household .
52	2	1	it churns out hd content , runs without many flaws and i 've yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early 1990 's .
53	4	1	that 's the only issue i 've ever had since working on macs in 1995 .
54	4	1	that 's a pretty impressive track record do n't you think ?
55	7	1	i find it much easier to type on and much more durable .
56	3	1	battery life- my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far .
57	3	1	i can usually go about 10 hours before i get down to 10 % battery life .
58	2	1	the touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes .
59	3	1	it 's also incredibly light , has a battery that can last for days , and looks like a piece of art .
60	7	1	2 . keyboard is great
61	2	1	i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job
62	2	0	2 . viewing angles are not great .
63	5	0	5 . i found the track pad not great .
64	7	0	the wireless keyboard ( not bluetooth , but rf ) did not pair up with the device .
65	7	0	it still did not pair .
66	7	0	i even ran it as administrator -- still no effect .
67	7	0	i used the ctrl-esc keys while turning on , and still nothing .
68	7	0	it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out .
69	7	0	i still ca n't pair it .
70	7	0	i do n't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional .
71	4	0	but sony does n't seem to have addressed it .
72	6	1	machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp .
73	2	0	this laptop has no : - touchscreen - optical drives ( ok , a bit of a stretch , because that would eat up precious space in this monster ) - swivel or detachable screen
74	5	0	this is really nice , but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking .. sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't .. may be the laptop , may be the laptop in conjunction with windows 8 ?
75	5	0	either way , highly annoying .
76	5	0	overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop ( the mouse was the only negative i could really see ) ...
77	2	1	i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform .
78	2	1	it 's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen .
79	7	1	i 've only had this for a week overall i like the computer , it 's thin & amp ; light and the wireless keyboard works great .
80	3	1	it 's light , fast and has great battery ! !
81	7	1	the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially .
82	2	1	the screen looked fine to me and was n't an issue like others have been saying .
83	1	1	furthermore , mac os x mountain lion 's gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans , which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed .
84	7	1	the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit , which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing ( typing ? ) .
85	2	1	overall , the screen resolution , though non-retina , is sufficient for normal web browsing and work .
86	5	1	the glass track pad is large enough for apple 's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers , zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers , accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers .
87	5	1	for windows users switching to a mac , you can also enable right clicking ( known to apple as secondary click ) in the system preferences & gt ; mouse and enabling right clicking .
88	6	1	the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal .
89	6	1	the mac app store is your one-stop shop for mac software , though you can also download software online at your own risk .
90	6	1	there are currently around 10,000 apps on the app store ( and counting ... ) , and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store .
91	6	1	itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it 's simple to use user interface .
92	2	0	glare is also pretty frustrating .
93	4	1	but , hey , it 's an apple .
94	4	1	i would n't expect anything less !
95	4	0	if it was possible to give them 0 start , i would have done it .
96	7	0	my laptop 's one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure .
97	0	0	my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs , they quoted me $ 755 for it .
98	4	0	this company just wants customers ' money in their pocket .
99	4	0	they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars .
100	4	0	i wish this company to go bust .
101	4	0	i will never ever buy any apple product in my life .
102	7	0	also , and this maybe is another personal quirk , but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop .
103	0	1	if i were to have any technical difficulties , the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap , it was quite impressive .
104	3	0	3 . can not manually take battery out , unless you work for apple or have the tools
105	1	1	i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10 , but it is pretty awesome .
106	4	1	they really know what they are doing .
107	4	1	if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac .
108	4	1	the investment is worth it .
109	1	1	mac user interface is just the best .
110	4	0	not impressed with macintosh products .
111	4	0	in fact i am completely frustrated .
112	1	0	also , many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform .
113	1	1	the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use
114	3	1	the battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours , making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger .
115	1	1	reliability : throughout the past few years , i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws .
116	6	1	the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly .
117	0	1	pros : o it usually runs very smoothly , but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers .
118	3	1	o it has an extended battery life .
119	1	1	cons : o some people do n't enjoy the way the processing system runs , but do n't have any issues with getting it to function .
120	3	0	battery does n't hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurb 'd and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price ( just a guess ) .
121	2	0	screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger .
122	2	0	the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light .
123	7	0	keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best .
124	5	0	the touch pad feel is a 4 on scale 1 - 10 .
125	2	1	runs fast , the touch screen has n't lost any sensitivity , i 'm overall very happy with it .
126	5	0	this one does n't do that .
127	5	0	the trackpad is pretty crappy - but are n't they all ?
128	1	1	ios does everything its billed to do and much , much more .
129	1	1	literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind .
130	1	1	i ca n't believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes .
131	3	1	the batter lasts as long as claimed .
132	3	1	i get about 5 or so hours playing the sims .
133	3	1	i have n't really officially tested it yet , but it 's a long time .
134	3	1	i hate plugging my laptop in because i do n't want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery , but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it .
135	2	1	the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus .
136	1	0	the only problem i have is with windows 8 .
137	1	0	i hate windows 8 .
138	1	0	it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes wo n't let me download things that are harmful to my computer , but that 's what anti virus software is for lol .
139	2	0	i bought my first macbook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy , but what was not my surprise when i turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black .
140	2	0	i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead .
141	1	1	the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files .
142	0	1	and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free !
143	0	0	the online customer service was awful .
144	0	0	gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile .
145	0	0	no one would ever answer my question as to why i could n't get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty .
146	0	0	as a matter of fact , no matter how many times i asked that question , the employees i spoke purposely ignored it .
147	0	0	they did n't say yes and they did n't say no , they just pretended that i never asked it , which was incredibly frustrating .
148	0	1	i 've been to the & amp ; # 34 ; genius & amp ; # 34 ; bar several times ( they have been very nice ) .
149	1	1	one os for this platform , no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates .
150	1	1	i 'm no power user , but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i do n't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os .
151	6	1	i did buy office 2008 for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $ 64 and that was a steal in my opinion .
152	4	1	otherwise i am happily a mac user .
153	4	1	but apple does not pretend it has any of these .
154	2	0	the macbook pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac , but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution .
155	4	0	so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .
156	0	0	they did not replace the motherboard .
157	0	0	instead they 'tightened ' a loose wire .
158	0	0	it also has a big new scratch on the top cover .
159	0	0	i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix .
160	0	0	so i 'm going back to genius bar for visit # 6 .
161	1	0	mac is complicated and frustrating at moments .
162	1	0	i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough .
163	5	0	when i first got the computer , i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click .
164	3	0	i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling .
165	0	0	they tried to tell me that the battery was n't covered by the warranty and it costs about $ 150 to replace .
166	3	0	other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long , i 'm pretty happy with the computer .
167	6	0	opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever , as do all programs that do not begin with an ' i ' .
168	1	0	the free upgrade to mountain lion failed .
169	2	0	it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again .
170	4	0	i ca n't believe people like these computers .
171	4	0	now that they are not virus free ( [ ... ] l ) i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower , more expensive , and do not last as long .
172	0	0	hp was no help .
173	7	0	the lettering wore off the keys , so you better be able to type blind .
174	3	0	the battery lasted 12 months , then pffft ..... gone .
175	0	0	the disks i made would n't work ..... hp support stated & quot ; we 're a hardware company , not a software company. & quot ;
176	4	0	then there was a power cord recall .... hp never notified us ..... and we did register ...... never again .
177	4	0	i do n't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support , search functions , or hold times ..... dropped the hp and never looked back .
178	1	1	i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice .
179	1	1	i also like i have the option to push calendars , photos , and contacts to an ipad , ipod touch , or iphone ( if i had any of those ) .
180	6	0	the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though & amp ; # 34 ; home sharing & amp ; # 34 ; ( i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer ) but i could not figure that out .
181	6	0	i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re-downloaded my amazon music ( losing my ratings ) .
182	5	0	received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed .
183	5	0	to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down .
184	5	0	when i attach a mouse it 's fine but the touchpad is really annoying .
185	5	0	i went through the settings and there is n't a way to fix it .
186	5	0	it 's a great laptop , but right now it 's annoying to use the touchpad .
187	6	0	this computer periodically crashes ( office , iphoto , safari ) .
188	2	0	but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile .
189	2	1	it has a stunning retina display , and is very fast .
190	2	1	the hd display is sensational , and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me .
191	3	1	it gives me everything i need from a computer and with the long lasting battery , it also gives me mobility .
192	6	1	no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall .
193	1	1	the big deal with this was windows 7 .
194	2	1	the retina display is fantastic .
195	2	0	the glare of the glossy-retina display is unbearable .
196	4	0	do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved .
197	7	0	fantastic for the price - just wish it the keys were illuminated .
198	1	0	windows runs very poorly .
199	3	1	awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging !
200	1	0	hate windows 8.1 !
201	7	0	the only reason i did n't give it a 5 star is , i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board .
202	7	0	you also have to press firmly on the keys .
203	1	0	it also gave me an introduction to windows 8 , which i hope will be discontinued it the future .
204	0	1	they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day .
205	2	0	fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test .
206	2	1	the screen is big , and everything was as described
207	3	1	the battery will get you from la to ny no problem .
208	2	1	it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing .
209	7	1	plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard .
210	6	1	no junkware ! !
211	2	0	screen broke 1 month outside warranty .
212	4	0	avoid acer .
213	2	1	retina display is beautiful .
214	3	1	the battery life is good , even with using high profile software like sibelius 7 for a good half of the day .
215	2	1	it has a wide screen and it 's easy to use .
216	5	0	i ca n't use the trackpad very well , it 's too sensitive , so i hooked up a mouse .
217	1	1	windows 7 rocks .
218	2	1	bigger screen than expected , laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage , including programming/editing
219	1	1	one of the very few laptops still available with win 7 pro , multiple usb ports , and a dvd read/write drive .
220	4	1	great laptop from apple !
221	4	1	apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality .
222	3	1	i can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge .
223	2	1	size is perfect and display is beautiful !
224	2	1	the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity .
225	2	0	so far i do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor .
226	2	0	so i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality , other than that it is a great buy !
227	3	0	the battery life is a joke and it 's causing other problems .
228	3	1	this things run smoothly for its price , and the battery life seems to go on forever .
229	7	1	it was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had a ) a side keyboard .
230	1	0	the only con is windows effin 8 .
231	2	1	still giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen .
232	3	0	battery does n't last long web browsing ( 2.5 hours maybe ) .
233	6	0	it has some bloat wear that i wish were n't there .
234	1	1	the home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing i was mainly concerned about .
235	3	1	internet is fast and reliable , battery life lasts a long time .
236	3	1	the battery is pretty soild .
237	3	1	it lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use .
238	1	0	i 'm also not a fan of windows 8 , but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue .
239	7	1	my favorite colors black and red , the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard .
240	2	1	the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast .
241	7	1	i like the number pad for work so that 's nice
242	6	0	only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software .
243	2	1	the display is good quality .
244	3	1	the battery seems adequate for most uses ~ 4.5 hour use/charge .
245	2	1	screen is clear and bright .
246	3	1	good battery life as well .
247	0	0	dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience .
248	0	0	i have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them ( over 4 different calls ) , only to get no where .
249	0	0	now i 'm looking into the return process , which i 'm sure will just be loads of fun , if my prior experience is any indication .
250	4	0	seriously , save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company .
251	4	0	used to love hp products , but this has soured me on the whole company .
252	3	0	my only concern is that since the battery is not external , i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time .
253	5	0	the mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars .
254	7	1	several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why -- - this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we 've ever owned .
255	7	1	i 'm a life-long desktop computer user , and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a `` normal '' keyboard as i 've ever seen .
256	3	1	battery life is above average , and it charges quickly .
257	7	1	keyboard is sturdy .
258	4	1	i will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases .
259	3	1	the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable , and has a web cam .
260	1	0	other than a hate of windows 8 , she just loves it .
261	2	1	the build is perfect , the screen fantastic , but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything , from vga cables to ethernet cables , so , almost perfect ...
262	2	1	1.great display .
263	2	1	love the color accuracy .
264	4	0	i have had dell desktops for years , so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop .
265	4	1	i 've always sworn by dell .
266	1	1	so with this new order , all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul .
267	6	0	in addition , no matter what i do to change the settings , add/delete flash , etc. , firefox hangs on start-up .
268	4	0	it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on .
269	7	1	one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard , which is larger than usual .
270	7	1	it 's a pleasure to type on .
271	5	0	immediately did n't like the track buttons .
272	2	1	i purchased a dell inspiron i3531-1200bk and so far i love it , this model has a true life monitor , which is worth the extra bucks .
273	5	0	would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly .
274	5	0	it was not responsive at all to touch .
275	5	0	and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work , your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse .
276	7	0	the ' a ' key became jammed so that sometimes it would n't press in .
277	4	0	dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes .
278	5	0	the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive .
279	5	0	i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available , but nothing has helped .
280	5	0	also , the touchpad is almost 'sticky ' , which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad .
281	4	0	i would love to keep this laptop , but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand .
282	4	0	no lenovo for me .
283	3	0	but now i am having battery problems .
284	5	0	most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad .
285	1	1	the windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome .
286	5	0	but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing , my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it 's really annoying .
287	5	0	i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad , i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else .
288	5	0	a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier .
289	4	0	i will never buy another lenovo anything !
290	5	0	unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop , do n't buy this .
291	5	0	the touchpad has n't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning , i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i 've worked with have some inherent oddities .
292	5	0	this one however , is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work , then suddenly , i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own .
293	5	0	today , it has n't worked at all more than it has .
294	2	1	can run cs : go at 60 fps on low settings .
295	1	1	i liked the fact that it came with windows 7 , but also included windows 8 to install later if i need it .
296	5	1	i use a wireless mouse , but the touch pad and the `` red button '' in the middle that works like a little `` joystick '' also work fine .
297	2	1	the screen is good , the whole things is very light and does n't run hot .
298	6	1	i put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm .
299	0	0	dell support was awful to deal with .
300	1	0	the 8.1 windows is a major disappointment .
301	1	0	operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain !
302	2	1	the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable .. this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus .
303	2	0	used 6 times black screen returned for refund
304	6	0	do not use the facial recognition
305	1	0	windows 8 is not supported by a lot of things !
306	1	0	price is great , wish it did n't have windows 8 , but that is an opinion .
